:cyclone:**_Entrance:_**
The task assigned to us involves the development of a web-based application for geospatial data management, focusing on using a web framework and integrating the geographic aspect through OpenLayers. Primary goals include implementing functions such as data filtering, insertion, and deletion, as well as user authentication and authorization to accommodate different levels of access. OpenLayers, an open-source JavaScript library for displaying maps, is instrumental in incorporating the geographic features required for the project.

:cyclone:**_Basic functions:_**

:computer: **_Data Filtering:_**
The application allows users to filter data based on specific attributes. For example, users can choose to view only cafes with a score of 4.5 and above. Similarly, when shopping on a website, it provides convenience for people to choose to shop from sellers with a score above 4. This improves user experience by providing relevant and targeted information.

:computer: **_Adding Data:_**
The interface provides a mechanism for adding new data. Users can enter relevant information, including geographic coordinates, to incorporate new data points into the system. This ensures that the app stays up to date with the latest information and coordinate data.

:computer: **_Data Deletion:_**
The app allows users to delete existing data through a user-friendly interface. This functionality is critical to maintaining data accuracy and validity over time.
Again, this is a necessary process for up-to-dateness. We must remove a cafe that is no longer in place.

:computer: **_User Authentication/Authorization:_**
To address security and access control, the application implements user authentication and authorization. Users are divided into different roles with varying privilege levels. Some users, such as administrators, may have privileged access to view and modify data, while others may only have view-only access. For example, customers may only need the café's location and menu.

:cyclone:**_In summary, in this project:_**
We are in an effort to develop a web-based application focusing on Geospatial data management. The project emphasizes application security with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms. Measures such as regular updates, encryption, and secure coding practices have been taken to minimize security risks. Using OpenLayers, geospatial data is effectively managed through a user-friendly interface. The application organizes access to geospatial data on a role-based basis, providing users with filtering, adding and deleting capabilities. Future enhancements include more advanced filtering options, integration with additional mapping APIs and optimization for mobile devices. The project focuses on the goal of becoming a long-lasting application, addressing security concerns through regular updates and maintenance.

:cyclone:**_Challenges We Encountered and Possible Solutions:_**


To ensure the security of our application, implementing strong user authentication and authorization mechanisms was an important goal. In order to minimize security risks, we adopted measures such as regular updates, encryption and secure coding practices. Our proposed web-based application successfully meets the stated requirements by offering a user-friendly interface for geospatial data management. The effective use of OpenLayers provides a modern solution, while the integration of authentication and authorization features increases overall security and flexibility. With this application, users can filter, add and delete geospatial data based on their role with appropriate access levels. Future enhancements may include adding more comprehensive filtering options, integration with additional mapping APIs, and optimization for mobile devices. Regular updates and maintenance are required to address security concerns and ensure the longevity of the app.

:cyclone:**_Web Developing:_**

We create website on our "localhost".

But we can't go on. We take an error that we couldn't handle it.

We uploaded on before deadline. We are still working on it. But, we can't upload a video.
